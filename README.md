# Privacy Policy – TapGuide

TapGuide respects your privacy.

TapGuide is designed to help users understand apps on their phone by explaining what is shown on the screen when the user requests help.

## Data Collection
TapGuide does not collect, store, or share personal data such as messages, contacts, payment information, passwords, or personal files.

## Accessibility Service Usage
TapGuide uses Android’s Accessibility Service only to detect which app is open and to read basic UI labels so it can explain screens and provide guidance.
TapGuide does not perform actions on behalf of the user, does not read private content, and does not record the screen.

## Overlays
TapGuide displays a small floating help button so users can request guidance at any time. This button can be moved or hidden by the user.

## Data Sharing
TapGuide does not share user data with third parties.

## Children’s Privacy
TapGuide is not designed specifically for children under the age of 13.
